# CDAdvanceFilter

- This repository is used to create slide filter totally from json.
- Custom configurations can be set in your FilterModel, which is required to conform to `CDAdvanceFilter` protocol. 
- Getter and setter for current params of filter is supported.


### TODO:

##### More Functions:

- Multiple selection supported.
- Checkbox type supported.
- Maybe, selector type? ～_～ 


##### Optimization:

- Auto-correct for range type. eg: type "5 - 1" in normal range, auto-correct it to "1 - 5" after clicking "Confirm" button.
- The same for date range type.
